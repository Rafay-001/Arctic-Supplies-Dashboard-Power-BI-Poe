# Arctic-Supplies-Dashboard-Power-BI
Developed Multi-page Dashboard for the Arctic Supplies as a part of final course project in HSE University, Spb., Russia
Arctic Star Supplies imports and exports specialty foods from around the world. I as a BI Analyst assigned to build a dashboard that will reflect the performance of the company. My management would like to track metrics such as total revenue, the amount of shipping costs, average order processing time for managers, the number of orders per manager, and so on.

*Dataset Description*
The dataset contains the sales data of Arctic Star Supplies for the period from 2013 to 2015. 
Dataset contains the following tables: 
1. Customers: stores customer information 
2. Orders: stores transaction sale orders from customers 
3. Categories: product category names 
4. Employees: information about Sales managers 
5. Order_Details: detailed information about each order 
6. Products: Product information including productName, unitPrice, etc 
7. Shippers: The details of the shippers who ship the products from the traders to the end-customers 
There is also a Calendar table that contains a sequence of dates starting from 01.01.2013 and ending on 31.12.2015. From this Calender table I wrote DAX to further breakdown this into Monthly, Quarterly, Year-month, Year so that I can do time intelligence.

I developed multi-page dashboard starting from the Executive Summary, Product & Order Analysis, and concluded on Manager's Performance dashboard.
